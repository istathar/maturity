A technical capability and operational maturity model
=====================================================

This library presents a small DSL-ish allowing you to describe the progress of
a small software initiative.

Note we didn't say "project". Those tend to be large, long running, and
subject to political factors that are beyond the narrow scope of having an
idea and delivering it some form for others to use. Initiatives are ideas or
concepts that, if pursued, would give some advantage or capability to further
the organization.
